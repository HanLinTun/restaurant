        <h2>Welcome To Our Website</h2>
        <p>There's absolutely nothing funny about the coronavirus pandemic. But being quarantined with your family and roommates? Face it, things can get pretty hilarious. And weird! Are you still on the hunt for toilet paper or did you manage to squirrel
            away enough to last for the next several decades? Are you suddenly a homeschool teacher? Great! Are your kids just the most delightful students? No? Are they driving you bonkers yet? How about your spouse? Are they keeping things sanitized
            or eating all the snacks while learning to play the guitar? Read on for the funny quotes you need to get you through quarantine! If you're feeling extra desperate for a laugh (and who isn't?!) here are 50 jokes so bad that you can't help but
            giggle.
